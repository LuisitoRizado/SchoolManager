# SchoolManager
This a application for managing schools
It was a project for university, so i decided to upload it here.

The project consist in that there's an administrator wich can upload an manage alumns, 
You just have to loggin as an administrator:
Some of the users and passwords for this are :

username: 8080
password: Luisito

Otherside, you can be an alumn, being an alumn means that you can check your schedule, 
califications, and other kind of alumns things.

Some of the users and passwords for alumns are: 

username: 3030 
password: Erick123

These interfaces look similar, but the accesses are very different, as i said, alumns can check groups, schedules, califications, etc...
and admins can manage all about alumns, teachers
